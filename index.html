	<h2>The story</h2>
	<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <i><q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q></i> The farmer said,<strong><i> <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></i></strong>
		The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <i><q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q></i>The farmer again said, <strong><i><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></i></strong></p>

	<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <i><q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span></q></i>, and the farmer responded,<strong><i> <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></i></strong> The next day the conscription officers came
		around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <i><q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q></i>Again, he said, <strong><i><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></i></strong>	</p>

	   <blockquote>
	 <p><i>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune.</i></p>

	<h2>Conclusion </h2>
	<p><span class="good">good</span> and <span class="bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
